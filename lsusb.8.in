.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsusb
is a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and
the devices connected to them.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Tells
.I lsusb
to be verbose and display detailed information about the devices shown.
This includes configuration descriptors for the device's current speed.
Class descriptors will be shown, when available, for USB device classes
including hub, audio, HID, communications, and chipcard.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP [[\fIbus\fP]\fB:\fP][\fIdevnum\fP]
Show only devices in specified
.I bus
and/or
.I devnum.
Both ID's are given in decimal and may be omitted.
.TP

Show only devices with the specified vendor and product ID.
Both ID's are given in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B \-D \fIdevice\fP
Do not scan the /dev/bus/usb directory,
instead display only information
about the device whose device file is given.

This option displays detailed information like the \fBv\fP option;
you must be root to do this.

to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree. This overrides the
